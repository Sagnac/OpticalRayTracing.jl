    Lens(surfaces::Matrix{Float64})

Construct a lens from a 3 column surface matrix where the first column corresponds to the radii of curvature, the second column to the thicknesses, and the third to the refractive indices.

The computed result wraps a two column lens matrix where the first column refers to the reduced thickness `τ = t /n` of the distance prior to the surface and the second column refers to the surface power.

    aberrations(surfaces, system, [λ], [δn])

Compute third order wavefront error coefficients based on Seidel sums for a given system or ray basis. Results are in waves at the d-line by default. The dispersion vector `δn` allows calculation of chromatic aberration.

The returned `Aberration` type holds the per surface contributions in the `WIJK` fields (e.g. `W040`) while the system totals are held in the long form `spherical`, `astigmatism`, etc. fields.
